# Collaboration

Collaboration in Git and GitHub refers to the process of multiple people working together on the same project, managing changes, and integrating their contributions seamlessly.  It involves using Git's branching and merging capabilities, along with GitHub's pull request workflow, to coordinate efforts, review code, and ultimately build a cohesive and functional project.
