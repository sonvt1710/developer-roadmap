# Learn the Basics

Git is like a save button for your code, allowing you to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with others without overwriting each other's work. GitHub, on the other hand, is a website and platform that provides hosting for your Git repositories (projects), making it easy to share, manage, and collaborate on code with others remotely.
