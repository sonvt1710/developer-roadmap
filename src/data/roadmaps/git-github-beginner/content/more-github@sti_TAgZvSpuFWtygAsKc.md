# More GitHub

GitHub isn't just about storing code; it's a collaborative platform. It offers features beyond basic version control, such as project management tools like issue tracking, where you can report bugs and suggest new features. You can also use GitHub's collaboration features, like pull requests, to propose changes to a project, fostering community involvement and code review.
